# Coffee Shop: Frontend

Coffee shop appâ€™s frontend hosted locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8100/`.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

First, ensure you are using the right version of Node.js (`^14.15`). Then, install the Ionic CLI following instructions in the framework's [documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

Once you clone the current repo into your local machine, you can go inside the repo and run:
```
$ npm install
```
to install the right versions of packages for running scripts in the project repo.

### Running the Frontend

Ionic ships with a useful development server which detects changes and transpiles as you work. The application is then accessible through the browser on a localhost port (`http://127.0.0.1:8100/`). To run the development server, run:
```
$ ionic serve
```

>_TIP_: Do not use this in production. Instead, build Ionic into a build artifact for your desired platforms.
Check out the [documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/build) to learn more.
