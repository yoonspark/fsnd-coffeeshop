# Coffee Shop

This is a simple web application for accessing and processing drink information at a coffee shop.

The application supports three types of users:
1. *Customers*, who can only view basic drink info
2. *Baristas*, who can also view detailed drink info (e.g., recipe)
3. *Managers*, who can perform all actions including creation and deletion of drink items

The application is locally hosted on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` ([backend](https://github.com/yoonspark/fsnd-coffeeshop/tree/master/backend))
and `http://127.0.0.1:8100/` ([frontend](https://github.com/yoonspark/fsnd-coffeeshop/tree/master/frontend)).
More details can be found in each stack's subdirectory.
